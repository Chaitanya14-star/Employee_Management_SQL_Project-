This project is a SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) solution that implements an Employee Management System, featuring a relational database with tables for employees, departments, roles, 
salaries, and attendance. It demonstrates core database design principles using primary and foreign keys, constraints, and relationships to ensure data integrity. The project includes SQL 
scripts for creating schemas, inserting sample data, and running queries to manage employee details, assign departments and roles, track payroll, and maintain attendance records. Serving as 
a practical example of applying SQL Server in a real-world scenario, it is useful for learners and developers to practice relational modeling, SQL queries, and database management concepts.
